# Knight Night
By Giovanni "Veirya" Oliver and 3 others.

Knight Night is an arcade-style retro game where you are a knight defending a village from an
endless horde of undead until you fall. Try to kill as many as you can to get a high score!

White Ghosts are worth 1 point, Black Ghosts and Pumpkins 3, and Skeletons 4. White Ghosts
can be launched by hitting them during a Shield Dash, and you gain extra points for sending
them far enough off-screen.

Controls:

Arrow Keys - Move

Spacebar - Swing Sword

Z - Shield Dash
